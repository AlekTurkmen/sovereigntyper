    text: "Nothing in the world is worth having or worth doing unless it means effort, pain, difficulty... I have never in my life envied a human being who led an easy life. I have envied a great many people who led difficult lives and led them well.",
    author: "Theodore Roosevelt"

    text: "Times of great calamity and confusion have been productive for the greatest minds. The purest ore is produced from the hottest furnace. The brightest thunder-bolt is elicited from the darkest storm.",
    author: "Charles Caleb Colton"
  },
  {
    text: "I have walked that long road to freedom. I have tried not to falter; I have made missteps along the way. But I have discovered the secret that after climbing a great hill, one only finds that there are many more hills to climb. I have taken a moment here to rest, to steal a view of the glorious vista that surrounds me, to look back on the distance I have come. But I can only rest for a moment, for with freedom come responsibilities, and I dare not linger, for my long walk is not ended.",
    author: "Nelson Mandela"

  },
  {
    text: "You will never ever be successful, until you turn your pain into greatness, until you allow your pain to push you from where you are to push you to where you need to be. Stop running from your pain and embrace your pain. Your pain is going to be a part of your prize, a part of your product. I challenge you to push yourself.",
    author: "Eric Thomas"

  {
    text: "The most difficult thing is the decision to act, the rest is merely tenacity. The fears are paper tigers. You can do anything you decide to do. You can act to change and control your life; and the procedure, the process is its own reward.",
    author: "Amelia Earhart"
  },
  {
    text: "To remain stagnant is a waste since movement is essential to achievement. Those consumed with the barriers of “what if’s” will avoid perceived risks and lean on excuses for inaction. Excuses keep those that are afraid of change from progressing.",

  },
  {
    text: "Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work. And the only way to do great work is to love what you do. If you haven't found it yet, keep looking. Don't settle. As with all matters of the heart, you'll know when you find it. And, like any great relationship, it just gets better and better as the years roll on.",
    author: "Steve Jobs"
  },
  {
    text: "The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions, and spends himself in a worthy cause.",
    author: "Theodore Roosevelt"
  },
  {
    text: "The knowledge that you have emerged wiser and stronger from setbacks means that you are, ever after, secure in your ability to survive. You will never truly know yourself, or the strength of your relationships, until both have been tested by adversity. Such knowledge is a true gift, for all that it is painfully won, and it has been worth more than any qualification I ever earned.",
    author: "J.K. Rowling"
  },
  {
    text: "In a sense, people are our proper occupation. Our job is to do them good and put up with them. But when they obstruct our proper tasks, they become irrelevant to us—like sun, wind, animals. Our actions may be impeded by them, but there can be no impeding our intentions or our dispositions. Because we can accommodate and adapt. The mind adapts and converts to its own purposes the obstacle to our acting. The impediment to action advances action. What stands in the way becomes the way.",
    author: "Marcus Aurelius"
  },
  {
    text: "True happiness is to enjoy the present, without anxious dependence upon the future, not to amuse ourselves with either hopes or fears but to rest satisfied with what we have, which is sufficient, for he that is so wants nothing. The greatest blessings of mankind are within us and within our reach. A wise man is content with his lot, whatever it may be, without wishing for what he has not.",
    author: "Seneca"
  },
  {
    text: "We live in a world with a lot of insecure, jealous people. Some of them are our best friends. They are blood relatives. Failure terrifies them. So does our success. Because when we transcend what we once thought possible, push our limits, and become more, our light reflects off all the walls they've built up around them. Your light enables them to see the contours of their own prison, their own self-limitations.",

  {
    text: "Rather, it has been the risk-takers, the doers, the makers of things—some celebrated, but more often men and women obscure in their labor—who have carried us up the long rugged path toward prosperity and freedom.",
    author: "Barack Obama"
  },
  {
    text: "It’s a lot more than mind over matter. It takes relentless self-discipline to schedule suffering into your day, every day, but if you do, you’ll find that at the other end of that suffering is a whole other life just waiting for you.",
    author: "David Goggins"
  },
  {
    text: "Never give in. Never give in. Never, never, never, never—in nothing, great or small, large or petty—never give in, except to convictions of honour and good sense. Never yield to force. Never yield to the apparently overwhelming might of the enemy.",
    author: "Winston Churchill"
  },
  {
    text: "You might never fail on the scale I did, but some failure in life is inevitable. It is impossible to live without failing at something, unless you live so cautiously that you might as well not have lived at all—in which case, you fail by default.",
    author: "J.K. Rowling"
  },
  {
    text: "Nothing in the world can take the place of persistence. Talent will not; nothing is more common than unsuccessful men with talent. Genius will not; unrewarded genius is almost a proverb. Education will not; the world is full of educated derelicts. Persistence and determination alone are omnipotent.",
    author: "Calvin Coolidge"
  },
  {
    text: "Far better it is to dare mighty things, to win glorious triumphs, even though checkered by failure, than to take rank with those poor spirits who neither enjoy much nor suffer much, because they live in the gray twilight that knows neither victory nor defeat.",
    author: "Theodore Roosevelt"
  },
  {
    text: "I'm convinced that about half of what separates the successful entrepreneurs from the non-successful ones is pure perseverance. It's so hard, and you pour so much of your life into this thing; there are such rough moments, and most people give up. That is what separates the ones that will succeed from the ones that don't.",
    author: "Steve Jobs"
  },
  {
    text: "Imagination is more important than knowledge. For knowledge is limited to all we now know and understand, while imagination embraces the entire world, and all there ever will be to know and understand.",
    author: "Albert Einstein"
  },
  {
    text: "You will encounter issues you didn’t expect, step on landmines. It’s bad. Years two to four or five are usually quite difficult. A friend has a saying, it’s ‘eating glass and staring into the abyss.’ If you’re a co-founder or CEO, you have to do all kinds of tasks you might not want to do. If you don't do your chores, the company won't succeed; no task is too menial.",
    author: "Elon Musk"
  },
  {
    text: "There are way easier places to work, but nobody ever changed the world on 40 hours a week. You need to work about 80 hours, maybe more; that's the number where pain level is manageable. Work like hell—every waking hour—because if other people are working forty and you're working a hundred, you'll achieve in four months what they achieve in a year.",
    author: "Elon Musk"
  },
  {
    text: "I've missed more than 9,000 shots in my career. I've lost almost 300 games. Twenty-six times I've been trusted to take the game-winning shot and missed. I've failed over and over and over again in my life. And that is why I succeed.",
    author: "Michael Jordan"
  },
  {
    text: "Some people want it to happen, some wish it would happen, others make it happen. I can accept failure—everyone fails at something—but I can't accept not trying. To learn to succeed, you must first learn to fail; once you do that, you'll never fear losing.",
    author: "Michael Jordan"
  },
  {
    text: "Keep this constantly in mind. Weak desires bring weak results, just as a small amount of fire makes a small amount of heat. When your desires are strong enough, you will appear to possess superhuman powers to achieve.",
    author: "Napoleon Hill"
  },
  {
    text: "Every adversity, every failure, every heartache carries with it the seed of an equal or greater benefit. So when defeat overtakes you, rest if you must, but never quit, for within that temporary setback lies the germ that will bring you to higher levels of achievement than you have ever known.",
    author: "Napoleon Hill"
  },
  {
    text: "All our dreams can come true if we have the courage to pursue them. The way to get started is to quit talking and begin doing; first imagine your castle in the clouds, then roll up your sleeves and build its foundation of stone with steady, purposeful work.",
    author: "Walt Disney"
  },
  {
    text: "If you can dream it, you can do it. First, think—second, believe—third, dream—and finally, dare. When you believe in a thing, believe in it all the way, implicitly and unquestionable; that faith will carry you through the moments when the world says it cannot be done.",
    author: "Walt Disney"
  },
  {
    text: "Our greatest weakness lies in giving up. The most certain way to succeed is always to try just one more time. I haven’t failed; I’ve just found ten thousand ways that won’t work, and when you have exhausted all possibilities, remember this—you haven’t.",
    author: "Thomas Edison"
  },
  {
    text: "In any moment of decision, the best thing you can do is the right thing; the next best thing is the wrong thing; and the worst thing you can do is nothing. Do what you can, with what you have, where you are, and you will find that bold action carries you farther than any amount of cautious hesitation.",
    author: "Theodore Roosevelt"
  },
  {
    text: "Here's to the crazy ones—the misfits, the rebels, the troublemakers, the round pegs in the square holes. The ones who see things differently. While some may see them as the crazy ones, we see genius, because the people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world are the ones who actually do.",
    author: "Steve Jobs"
  },
  {
    text: "Say to yourself in the early morning: I shall meet today ungrateful, violent, treacherous, envious, uncharitable men; all of these have come upon them through ignorance of real good and ill. But I, who have seen the nature of the good, know that none of them can hurt me. ",
    author: "Marcus Aurelius"
  },
  {
    text: "If you are distressed by anything external, the pain is not due to the thing itself but to your estimate of it; and this you have the power to revoke at any moment by thinking differently, for the mind is its own master when it chooses to stand steady. ",
    author: "Marcus Aurelius"
  },
  {
    text: "It is not that we have a short time to live, but that we waste a lot of it. Life is long enough, and a sufficiently generous amount has been given to us for the highest achievements if it were all well invested. But when it is wasted in heedless luxury and spent on no good activity, we are forced at last by death’s final constraint to realize that it has passed away before we knew it was passing. ",
    author: "Seneca"
  },
  {
    text: "It is precisely in times of immunity from care that the soul should toughen itself beforehand for occasions of greater stress, and it is while Fortune is kind that it ought to fortify itself against her violence. In days of peace the soldier performs manoeuvres, throws up earthworks with no enemy in sight, and wearies himself by gratuitous toil in order that he may be equal to unavoidable toil. ",
    author: "Seneca"
  },
  {
    text: "If you want to improve, be content to be thought foolish and stupid with regard to external things. Don’t wish to be thought to know anything; and even if you appear important to others, distrust yourself, for it is difficult to guard the faculty of choice and at the same time acquire externals. ",
    author: "Epictetus"
  },
  {
    text: "Set before your eyes each day death and exile and everything else that seems terrible—especially death—and you will never entertain any base thought nor too eagerly desire anything. By rehearsing these possibilities, you prepare your mind to meet adversity with composure. ",
    author: "Epictetus"
  },
  {
    text: "Men are disturbed not by things, but by the views which they take of things. Thus death is nothing terrible; the terror lies in our notion of it. When therefore we are hindered, disturbed, or grieved, let us never impute it to others but to ourselves—that is, to the judgments we hold. ",
    author: "Epictetus"
  },
  {
    text: "Man conquers the world by conquering himself; for to govern one’s own desires is the first and noblest of victories, and self-control is the surest token of true freedom. ",
    author: "Zeno of Citium"
  },
  {
    text: "Well-being is realized by small steps, but it is truly no small thing. Every modest effort to master oneself compounds until the once-timid soul stands steady in storms that would topple empires built only on outward strength. ",
    author: "Zeno of Citium"
  },
  {
    text: "Lead me, Zeus and Destiny, wherever you have ordained me to go; I shall follow unflinchingly. But if through weakness I should hesitate, I will follow nonetheless. Fate leads the willing and drags the unwilling, yet what is rightly decreed must always run its course. ",
    author: "Cleanthes"
  },
  {
    text: "The philosopher’s body also must be well prepared for work, because virtues often use it as a necessary tool for the activities of life. We train both soul and body when we accustom ourselves to cold, heat, thirst, hunger, scarcity, abstaining from pleasures, and enduring pains. ",
    author: "Musonius Rufus"
  },
  {
    text: "Let philosophy be like nutritious food or physical exercise, staying with us always and guarding our judgments. It should not be something we consume once and discard, but a discipline that shapes every choice until wisdom becomes as habitual as breathing. ",
    author: "Musonius Rufus"
  },
  {
    text: "Take all my books and you will find the same message woven through each page: things that are in harmony with nature give us peace of mind; we suffer only when we set our hearts on what conflicts with the order of the universe. ",
    author: "Chrysippus"
  },
  {
    text: "I learned that courage was not the absence of fear, but the triumph over it. The brave man is not he who does not feel afraid, but he who conquers that fear, because true courage springs from the recognition that fear is natural and can be overcome with resolve. ",
    author: "Nelson Mandela"
  },
  {
    text: "I am fundamentally an optimist. Part of being optimistic is keeping one's head pointed toward the sun, one's feet moving forward. There were many dark moments when my faith in humanity was sorely tested, but I would not and could not give myself up to despair. That way lays defeat and death. ",
    author: "Nelson Mandela"
  },
  {
    text: "Everything can be taken from a man but one thing: the last of the human freedoms—to choose one’s attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one’s own way. Even in the worst situations, this power of choice remains indestructible and vital. ",
    author: "Viktor Frankl"
  },
  {
    text: "Discipline is the soul of an army. It makes small numbers formidable, procures success to the weak, and esteem to all. When men are trained to obey even in the toughest moments, they become instruments of order and guardians of the republic’s liberty. ",
    author: "George Washington"
  },
  {
    text: "Among the many interesting objects which will engage your attention, that of providing for the common defence will merit particular regard. To be prepared for war is one of the most effectual means of preserving peace. ",
    author: "George Washington"
  },
  {
    text: "The obstacle in the path becomes the path. Within every impediment lies an opportunity to practice virtue and gain strength. What stands in the way, properly faced, becomes the way forward. ",
    author: "Ryan Holiday"
  },
  {
    text: "What we fear doing most is usually what we most need to do. Define the worst-case scenario, accept that it could happen, and then take action anyway; on the far side of that fear lies the progress and freedom that routine comfort will always deny us. ",
    author: "Tim Ferriss"
  },
  {
    text: "Define your fears instead of your goals. For each fear, ask: what’s the worst that could happen, how could I minimize the damage, and what might be the benefits of even a partial success? Inaction almost always carries the greater cost, while action—however imperfect—opens the door to growth. ",
    author: "Tim Ferriss"
  },
  {
    text: "People and things do not upset us. Rather, we upset ourselves by believing that they can upset us; once we recognize that our emotions stem from our judgments, we unlock the power to think differently and, in so doing, to feel differently. ",
    author: "Albert Ellis"
  },
  {
    text: "The best years of your life are the ones in which you decide your problems are your own. You do not blame them on your mother, the ecology, or the president; you realize that you control your own destiny and the quality of your days depends chiefly on the way you think and act. ",
    author: "Albert Ellis"
  },
  {
    text: "You do not rise to the level of your goals; you fall to the level of your systems. Every ambitious vision must be backed by daily habits and routines that pull you inexorably toward it, because under pressure we default to the structures we have built. ",
    author: "James Clear"
  },
  {
    text: "Habits are the compound interest of self-improvement. Just as money multiplies through compound interest, the effects of your habits multiply as you repeat them. Each small action seems trivial today, yet over months and years it yields enormous dividends—or devastating debts—depending on whether the habit is good or bad. ",
    author: "James Clear"
  },
  {
    text: "The three most harmful addictions are heroin, carbohydrates, and a monthly salary—because each, in its own way, keeps you docile, craving the familiar fix while numbing the very hunger for possibility that makes a human being alive. ",
    author: "Nassim Nicholas Taleb"
  },
  {
    text: "Wind extinguishes a candle and energizes fire. Likewise with randomness, uncertainty, and chaos: you want to use them, not hide from them—be the fire and wish for the wind so that volatility becomes fuel for growth rather than the force of destruction.",
    author: "Nassim Nicholas Taleb"
  },
  {
    text: "Men seek retreats for themselves—houses in the country, at the shore, in the mountains—yet whenever you wish, you can retreat into yourself. Do not act as if you were going to live ten thousand years; death hangs over you. While you live, while it is in your power, be good. ",
    author: "Marcus Aurelius"
  },
  {
    text: "Your time is limited, so don’t waste it living someone else’s life. Don’t be trapped by dogma—living with the results of other people’s thinking. Don’t let the noise of others’ opinions drown out your own inner voice; have the courage to follow your heart and intuition.",
    author: "Steve Jobs"
  },
  {
    text: "At Amazon it’s still Day 1. Day 2 is stasis, followed by irrelevance, followed by excruciating, painful decline, followed by death. And that is why it is always Day 1. We have to obsess over customers, resist proxies, embrace external trends, and make high-velocity decisions to avoid slipping into Day 2.",
    author: "Jeff Bezos"
  },
  {
    text: "Persistence is very important. You should not give up unless you are forced to give up. Really pay attention to negative feedback and actively solicit it, particularly from friends—hardly anyone does that. It’s incredibly helpful.",
    author: "Elon Musk"
  },
  {
    text: "I’d rather be optimistic and wrong than pessimistic and right. Constantly think about how you could be doing things better, and keep questioning yourself. If something is important enough, even if the odds are against you, you should still do it.",
    author: "Elon Musk"
  },
  {
    text: "Someone is sitting in the shade today because someone planted a tree a long time ago. Long-term thinking, whether in investing or in life, means acting now so that benefits compound for decades after we’re gone.",
    author: "Warren Buffett"
  },
  {
    text: "We don’t have to be smarter than the rest. We have to be more disciplined than the rest. The most important quality for an investor is temperament, not intellect, because a steady temperament lets you stick with a sound plan when others panic.",
    author: "Warren Buffett"
  },
  {
    text: "We always overestimate the change that will occur in the next two years and underestimate the change that will occur in the next ten. Don’t let yourself be lulled into inaction; the future rewards those who make bold bets and patiently see them through.",
    author: "Bill Gates"
  },
  {
    text: "Success is a lousy teacher. It seduces smart people into thinking they can’t lose. Learning from failure keeps you humble enough to keep asking the hard questions and resilient enough to try again.",
    author: "Bill Gates"
  },
  {
    text: "The biggest risk is not taking any risk. In a world that is changing really quickly, the only strategy that is guaranteed to fail is not taking risks. Progress demands the courage to accept that mistakes are inevitable on the path to impact.",
    author: "Mark Zuckerberg"
  },
  {
    text: "Move fast and break things. Unless you are breaking stuff, you are not moving fast enough. Speed enables you to learn, iterate, and stay ahead of forces that would otherwise make you irrelevant.",
    author: "Mark Zuckerberg"
  },
  {
    text: "Solving big problems is easier than solving little problems. The bigger challenges inspire better talent, bigger thinking, and the commitment needed to invent solutions that move humanity forward.",
    author: "Sergey Brin"
  },
  {
    text: "Embrace what you don’t know, especially in the beginning, because what you don’t know can become your greatest asset. It ensures that you will absolutely be doing things differently from everybody else.",
    author: "Sara Blakely"
  },
  {
    text: "If you are not embarrassed by the first version of your product, you’ve launched too late. Releasing early lets you learn from real users and iterate toward something that truly scales.",
    author: "Reid Hoffman"
  },
  {
    text: "If people believe they share values with a company, they will stay loyal to the brand. Authenticity—expressed daily in products, service, and community—is what builds enduring relationships.",
    author: "Howard Schultz"
  },
  {
    text: "If you want to create and capture lasting value, don’t build an undifferentiated commodity business; competition is for losers. The road to monopoly runs through solving a unique problem better than anyone else.",
    author: "Peter Thiel"
  },
  {
    text: "Fearlessness is like a muscle. I know from my own life that the more I exercise it, the more natural it becomes not to let my fears run me. Each small act of courage builds the habit of daring greatly.",
    author: "Arianna Huffington"
